			<h2>Invitation</h2>
			<p>Hello there!</p>
			<p>You are invited on Arching Kaos SSB, a sosial network that is distributed and decentralised. Information (posts, likes, tags, personal messages etc) is stored on your device and is exchanged through your own network of friends in any way SSB finds (wifi, mobile data, bluetooth, networks in general). SSB is an open protocol, so in order to get connected you'll need a client.</p>
			<p>There are at least three application which can work with SSB:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork/releases/latest">Patchwork</a> for win/mac/linux</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/ssbc/patchbay/releases/latest">Patchbay</a> for win/mac/linux</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.manyver.se/">Manyverse</a> for android/iphones</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Because of the decentralised nature of the protocol, when you 'll open any of the application (and probably set a profile for yourself), you 'll be able to reach people that are inside your network (like LAN or a bluetooth hotspot). In order to expand your connectivity through internet, you'll need to use our invite code to the network: </p>
